# A Common Language

## Overview:

Now that we have Identities - the atomic units of the Intuition System - we can compose these Identities together into higher-order structures of data.

When Identities are connected with other identities, they are represented in Semantic/RDF Triple format. Triples, or ‘Claims’ as defined in the Intuition system, consist of three elements: a Subject, Predicate, and Object - very much akin to a sentence in natural language - with each element represented as an Identity (Atom).

For example, a Claim may be something like, [Vitalik] [founderOf] [Ethereum], wherein [Vitalik], [founderOf], and [Ethereum] are all Identities (individual Atoms) that compose the Claim (Triple).

Claims can also be Identities, allowing Claims to be used as Identities in other Claims - enabling the structuring of arbitrarily-complex statements.

This Subject-Predicate-Object format allows you to clearly and explicitly define and interpret relationships between
Identities, making the data extremely reconcilable, machine-readable, and usable. These connections can simplistically be visualized as a graph, resembling a network with nodes and edges, where each node and edge is an Identity.

## Instructions:

In this quest, you will be creating a Claim to express that an Identity is Web3-related.

You are welcome to reference anything, but it is advised to create a statement that you believe may provide value to the collective web3 conscious, as useful statements are inherently more likely to gain traction.

The goal is to share knowledge, create a more informed and safe digital ecosystem, and have fun gamifying social wisdom - and being early is always good!
