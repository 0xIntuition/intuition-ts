# Cascading Positions:

When you stake on a Claim, a portion of your deposit is automatically staked on the Claim’s underlying Identities. This inherent signaling of the Identity’s relevancy occurs because you are interacting with a Claim that includes them.

For example, if you stake on the Claim, [Vitalik] [founderOf] [Ethereum], you will also be staking on the Atoms [Vitalik], [founderOf], and [Ethereum]. This process enhances Intuition’s TCR (Token Curated Registry) by indicating which Identities are most frequently utilized.
