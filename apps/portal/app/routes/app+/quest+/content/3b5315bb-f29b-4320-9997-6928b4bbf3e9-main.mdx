# Express Your Conviction

## Overview

In Intuition, as in life, the power and meaning of things depends on the strength you give them.

To mirror this function in the digital realm of Intuition, you will allocate economic bandwidth to signal what you believe to be relevant and true. When you take ETH on an Identity (Atom), you are depositing into its respective ERC-4626-esque Vault. Then, whenever the Atom is interacted with, you as the creator will earn fees (as long as you remain staked on it).

These game theoretic mechanics help to highlight key information, acting as a tool to separate the signal from the noise through the creation of a Token Curated Registry (TCR) for data.

Because Intuition is entirely permissionless, anyone can create an Identity for any concept. Intuition’s economic incentives encourage convergence, helping to prevent data fragmentation, by rewarding users for consistently using consensus Identities to reference concepts across the web.

## Instructions:

To complete this quest, stake some ETH on your newly-created Identity. The act of ‘putting your money where your mouth is’ signals the importance and relevance of that identity not only to you but also to whoever chooses to view/interact with your data.
