# Atomic Knowledge

In the Intuition system, the foundational unit of knowledge is termed as the identity. Every entity and concept - be it a person, an organization, a word, a product, a protocol, etc. - has an identity, which serves as a conceptual anchor to which we attach and correlate data, experiences, and perceptions. Think of identities as the DNA or basic building block of the entire system.

Let’s use an example to practice. Think back to when you first started learning about web3 -- you were probably asking yourself questions like who should I follow, which projects are legitimate, is this a scam, what token should I buy, etc. And that is largely because there isn’t one single source of truth or database to learn about these things.

Now, think about any web3 project or topic that you believe provides value and that you think others might also find value from learning about. With that top of mind, let’s create an Identity about it.
