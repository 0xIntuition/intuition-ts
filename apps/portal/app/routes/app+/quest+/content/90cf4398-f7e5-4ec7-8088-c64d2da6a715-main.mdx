# Community-Driven Discovery

## Overview:

Now that we have signal semantically structured in a many-to-one fashion, we can introduce our first meta-primitive: Lists.

When Identities and Claims are used effectively, they enable the construction of queries with arbitrarily complex combinatorial logic. This allows the state of Intuition to be navigated easily, producing deterministic results.

Essentially, a List can be seen as the outcome of a query.

In the Claim creation quest, the Predicate of your Claim was ‘hasTag’ and the Object was ‘Web3’. With this, we can perform a query to return a List of Identities contained in Claims where the Predicate is ‘hasTag’ and the Object is ‘Web3’. This will return a global List of all Identities anyone has tagged with being Web3-related.

You could very easily filter this global List to see your List, a specific person’s List, or a List filtered through a social graph. And, you could very easily use this for all sorts of functionality, as either a user or a developer!

For instance, lists of songs by popularity, books by genre, movies by critic reviews, crypto wallets by Web3 experts, DAO delegates by reputation, computer keyboards by top developers, restaurants by foodies, ride-share drivers by Uber, houses to rent by AirBnb... the list of lists goes on.

This is the power of Intuition.
