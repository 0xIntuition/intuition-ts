# Express Your Truth

## Overview:

Just like Identities, Claims are only as powerful as the strength given to them. And, just like Identities, staking/depositing ETH, is the method for signaling and expressing what you believe to be relevant and true.

This decoupling of statements from the expression of those statements, enables a many-to-one attestation structure with many novel and advantageous properties - such as the ability to better handle subjective or non-deterministic attestations.

Each Claim in Intuition has two associated ERC-4626-esque Vaults—one for the 'positive' (true) side of the Claim and one for the 'negative' (false) side. Staking ETH in the 'positive' Vault would signify that you believe the statement within the Claim to be true, while staking ETH in the 'negative' Vault would indicate that you believe the statement to be false.

For example, consider the statement [Vitalik] [founderOf] [Ethereum]. This statement can exist without any active endorsement. To express agreement with this statement, you would deposit ETH into the respective positive Vault of the Claim, thereby expressing that you believe [Vitalik] [founderOf] [Ethereum] to be a true statement.

This creates a TCR for data structures, helping to solve the problem of folksonomies, where users oftentimes use similar but different ways to describe the same thing. In this model, data fragmentation issues are resolved through incentive-driven social consensus rather than through top-down hierarchically imposed taxonomies.

## Instructions:

Now, practice signaling your support For a Claim of your choosing by depositing into the ‘Positive’ Vault of the Claim (aka ‘Deposit For’).
